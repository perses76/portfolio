## Technologies

MS SQL, classic ASP, ASP.NET v2.0-4.5, BackboneJS, Angular, Web Api, XML, XSLT

## Challenges

As html pages is most time consuming part of application. We decided to use XML+XSLT to protect our investments.
As practice shows it was good choice. We are able to support project more than 10 years without deep refactoring.
Also designers have possibility to work on HTML code without server side. It significantly increased developing speed.
